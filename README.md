# Applied Data Analysis Homework 1: Scoring the Language Model Olympics
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores the performance of large language models (LMs) on the **Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)** benchmark. It is framed as part of the fictional Swiss government initiative Project NEUTRALITY (Navigating Efficient Upgrades Through Robust Artificial Learning Integration Techniques Yearly), which aims to identify the best LMs for supporting the education sector.

Through structured analysis, we:
- Inspect and clean noisy datasets collected from three anonymous LMs.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, biases, and inconsistencies.
- Rank the models based on their performance.
- Investigate tokenization effects.
- Provide a final recommendation for Project NEUTRALITY
